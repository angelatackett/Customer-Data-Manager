# Customer-Data-Manager

This Java program allows a user to manage customer data by providing a menu of options. 
The user can add a single or multiple customers, display all customers, retrieve data for
a specific customer, or retrieve a list of customers based on a sales range. The program 
uses a CustomerData class to store and manipulate the customer data. The program uses a 
scanner to obtain user input and a switch statement to route the user's selection to the 
appropriate method.
